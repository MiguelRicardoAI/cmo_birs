          <p>
            Workshop participation is by invitation only. Individual workshop organizers are responsible for drafting lists of potential invitees, not CMO or BIRS directly; however, if you are interested in participating in a particular workshop you can email a BIRS administrator, who will forward your statement of interest to one of the organizers involved. If you are a student we recommend sending a letter of recommendation from your supervisor along with your initial email.

          <p>
            BIRS is unfortunately unable to do this, for a number of reasons, particularly due to the sheer volume of information that we require from all participants, compatibility with our online database, and the occasional need for very prompt replies. If a participant is unable to be reached by email on a regular basis, he/she should contact his/her workshop contact organizer to make alternate arrangements.

              What is the purpose of the testimonials that participants and organizers are asked to volunteer to write after workshops?
            </b>
          </p>
          <p>
            The benefits of testimonials are three-fold.
          </p>
          <p>
            For participants, they provide an opportunity to think back on the past few days and to recall and organize one‚Äôs thoughts on what was learned throughout their time at CMO.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the workshop community at large, they enable people to see what stood out to their colleagues in each workshop; their colleagues may perhaps emphasize important aspects of the week they hadn‚Äôt before considered to be of note.
          </p>
          <p>
            For BIRS and CMO, feedback helps us to see our strengths and our weaknesses. Positive testimonials also enable us to show our sponsors that the funds they have granted us are being put to good use. Testimonials are invaluable to us in the funding renewal process and participants‚Äô taking the time to write one is thus very much appreciated!

              How do I write a testimonial?
            </b>
          </p>
          <p>
            You may be contacted directly by email by our Scientific Director, requesting you to give us your input. If so, a link should be included in the email and you need only follow the steps as they appear.
          </p>
          <p>
            If this is not the case, you can access a simple testimonial-writing page via our website at <a href="/feedback">http://www.birs.ca/feedback</a>.

              What sorts of remarks should I make in a testimonial?
            </b>
          </p>
          <p>
            The content of a testimonial is largely up to you. Some people choose to write long paragraphs, while other people simply jot down a sentence or two. You can reflect upon the organization of the workshop, the setting and facilities in Oaxaca, the mathematical and scientific aspects of your specific workshop, or whatever else you deem to be appropriate. There are some guidelines on what to include as potential ‚Äúscientific content‚Äù on our online testimonial-writing page at: <a href="/feedback">http://www.birs.ca/feedback</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can see examples of testimonials by following the link on the BIRS homepage, where we publish excerpts of testimonials for the various workshops held in our facilities at <a href="/testimonials/cmo">http://www.birs.ca/testimonials/cmo</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We endeavor to preserve the integrity of each testimonial, although we reserve the right to occasionally edit for grammar, clarity or anonymity, where appropriate.

            Participants can contribute their PDF, PowerPoint, or other types of files to their CMO-BIRS workshop web page, using the laptop computer on the table in the main lecture room. On the computer, there is an icon on the desktop named "workshop-webpage", pictured to the right. This is a network file system that is directly connected to the web server, for the current week's 5-day workshop. Simply drag & drop your files onto that icon, and the files will appear on the workshop webpage, under a link named "workshop-website".

            You should include your last name in the name of the file. This will allow others to identify it easily, and if you recorded a video, the file will appear underneath the video on the website.
